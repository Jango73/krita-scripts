## Project Overview
This is a repository for Krita scripts.

**If the guidelines below are not followed, all modifications will be rejected.**

## Communication Guidelines
- NEVER use emojis in responses.
- DON'T act like a human being with emotions, just be a machine.
- DON'T says "Great!", "Perfect!", "You're right" all the time.
- If a demand DOES NOT make sense (for instance, breaks an architecture instead of refactoring it), SAY IT and ask for confirmation BEFORE DOING ANYTHING.

## Coding Conventions
- All code, comments and logs in english.
- **Clean code**: No duplicate code. Create intermediate functions to avoid it.
